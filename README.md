Advent of Code
==============

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I'd urge you to try and solve a particular day before looking at on of my solutions.  You can do it!  I believe in you.

About Advent of Code
-----
AoC is a yearly (nonreligous) [Advent Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar), but instead of tiny Lego sets or chocolates, you get programming puzzles.  They always come in two parts, and you must solve the first puzzle of the day to unlock the second puzzle of the day.  The first puzzle on Christmas is a freebie, so there are 49 puzzles to solve in all.

The main page is ASCII art, revealed line-by-line, day-by-day.  Solve that day, and the line gets colored.  Solve all 49, and it gets all... shiny.

It's a speed competition and keeps a leaderboard, so some of this code was written *very* quickly.  (Sadly, I never got above [42nd place](https://adventofcode.com/2016/leaderboard/day/15).)  Also, because I was on a new laptop, I wrote the python in text editor rather than a proper IDE.  Doubly frustrating, I had no prewritten libraries, so hopefully next year, I'll be able to solve code that much faster.

*2017 Update:* I ended up without easy access to this GitHub when AoC 2017 started, so I got no speed boost from the libraries.  Also, I didn't really feel like staying up to try to solve puzzles as they come hot off the presses.

Only some solutions are present
-------------------------------
So, the code was written quickly, and without the aid of tooling, and the utilities were built on the fly as I needed them.

As a result, some of the code was *far* too embarrassing to share with the world, and thus the solution set is not exhaustive.

Personal stats
==============
Unlike [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/progress=MrPoush), there's no way to link to one's profile, so you'll have to take my word for it that I beat it.
